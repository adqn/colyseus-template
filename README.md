Basic Colyseus setup using React and Webpack. Runs client and server in one go.

###### Note: ```yarn install``` currently throws all dependencies into top-level node_modules folder. Doesn't really make a difference though it's kind of annoying. 

## Install and run:
```
git clone https://github.com/adqn/colyseus-stuff.git
cd colyseus-stuff
yarn install
yarn start
```
